- `/` is where the demos for the projects will be made. Also the presentations can stay here.
- `/src/` contains all the packages or modules. All the algorithms will be implemented here.
- `/resources/` is where the needed resource images and files are stored
- `/generated/` is where the generated images or files *may* be stored locally. The contents of this folder are not tracked.

Opening the `*.ipynb` requires a iPython notebook server. Don't worry if you don't care. This is my shenanigan.
